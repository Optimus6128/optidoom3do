Here is the source code of OptiDoom as I was working with it.

Not everything is gonna work out of the box.
I have a bunch of batch files, but also an .ahk file that connect to a util called AutoHotKey to automatically do the process with OperaFS tool (not sure if it has commandline support).
This is something you can also do manually, using the OperaFS tool to write the folder "takeme" to an ISO, after you copy the compiled executable "LaunchMe" inside this folder.
Then you also need to encrypt this ISO with the other tool provided, there is a batch file for this.

Anyway, I open this code mostly for those interested, I have my own makefile cause I couldn't use the original, also copied burger lib in here, that's exactly my workspace as I was developing this.
